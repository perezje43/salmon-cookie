      <h2> What is a Salmon Cookie? </h2>
      <hr></hr>
      <p> It sounds strange, but a salmon cookie is a wonderfully moist cookie
        thanks to the natural fish oils from the salmon that are locally sourced.
        You can't taste the fish, but you can feel rest assured that you're eating
        a healthy cookie chock full of nutrition! </p>
